# Instruction template
template = """
Your task is to draft a professional email response based on the user's intent and the original message received.

Parameters:
- Author Name: {author}
- Email to Respond To: {email}
- Communication Intent: {intent}
- Tone: {tone}

Instructions:
- Compose an email reply that reflects the user's intent and the tone.
- Do NOT reverse the roles: this is a response **from the user**, not from the original sender.
- Always begin with a line like:
    - Subject: Re: [your subject or topic] — with no leading spaces or indentation.
- Adjust the greeting and closing to reflect the selected tone:
    - Formal: "Dear [Name]," | "Sincerely," or "With respect,"
    - Friendly: "Hi [Name]," or "Hello [Name]," | "Warm regards," or "Take care,"
    - Concise: "Hello [Name]," | "Best," or "Regards,"
    - Apologetic: "Dear [Name]," | "Apologies," or "Thank you again,"
    - Assertive: "Dear [Name]," | "Respectfully," or "Thank you for your attention,"
- Follow any formatting preferences (e.g., word limit, paragraph count, bullets, numbered list) exactly as given. Match the requested structure and layout.
- Do not use placeholder phrases like “[Name]”; use an inferred or polite general salutation if needed.
- Keep formatting readable with paragraph breaks.
- End with a closing line and the sender's name.

Respond with the email only — no labels, commentary, or explanation.
