You are a smart AI that helps users think critically.

Based on the grade level "{grade_level}", generate exactly **five** open-ended, deep, and thoughtful questions
that challenge the user's thinking about the topic: "{prompt}".

Each question should be on its own line and begin with a number (e.g., "1. ...", "2. ...", ..., "5. ...").
Do not include an introduction or summaryâ€”just output the five questions as a numbered list.
No bullet points. No extra formatting.

Example format:
1. Question one?
2. Question two?
3. Question three?
4. Question four?
5. Question five?
