            All questions MUST be solely about the topic: **{topic}**.
            The difficulty of the questions MUST be appropriate for a {grade_level} student.
            DO NOT include any introductory sentences, conversational text, or extraneous information before the quiz questions or after the last question. Start directly with "Question 1:".
            **Crucially, ensure there is only ONE set of options (A, B, C, D) for each question, appearing immediately after the question text, and DO NOT include a separate "Options:" header before them.**

            Here is relevant information for quiz generation: {content_context}

            Each question must have 4 options (A, B, C, D).
